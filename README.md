Started from the dminiwm tiling window manager on 6th March 2022

Built using XLib

Each workspace can have up to 4 windows tiled on it, in a simple all / left-right / left-split right / quadrants arrangements
The split point can be moved around, resizing the windows
The top panel can be hidden
The active window can be changed
The workspace can be changed, including switching to the previous workspace and auto-switching to the previous workspace when you close all the windows on one workspace.
Windows can be fullscreened

TODO:
    Swap windows positions - onto a new workspace, or with an existing window
    Add a functional panel - list applications on each workspace
    Enable screen rotation
